//! Manages QActions and their shortcuts
/**
 * An ActionManager object is meant to manage all actions for one
 * widget class. All actions are addressed by their internal name
 * (a string that must be unique within the widget class). The manager
 * stores multiple QActions per internal name, i.e., one action
 * per instance of the widget class. The text of the action is the
 * localized string of the action while the internal name is never
 * translated as it is meant to be used to identify the action in the
 * configuration of the application. The localized text is taken
 * from the last added action or removed action for each internal name.
 * The managed widgets can change their language as often as needed
 * but should have the same language all the time. Otherwise, the
 * language of actionText() will depend on the order of the action addition.
 * Actions that are deleted (e.g., when their widget is deleted) are automatically
 * removed from the manager. The keyboard shortcuts assigned to an internal name
 * are preserved even when no action of the type exists.
 * If setShortcuts() has been called before addAction() the action's shortcuts
 * are replaced in addAction(). If setShortcuts() has not been called
 * before the first call to addAction() (for a specific name that is) the
 * shortcuts of the first added action will be taken for all other added actions.
 *
 * The typical usage of ActionManager is:
 * - read configured shortcuts from the configuration files of the application and
 *   call ActionManager::setShortcuts() for each of them
 * - create an instance of the widget class
 *   -# create actions for the widget
 *   -# call ActionManager::addAction() for each action
 *   -# if the configuration files contained a shortcut for the action, it will
 *      be set for the added action, otherwise the default shortcut set in
 *      the widget initialization code will be preserved
 * - create more instances of the widget class and register their actions
 *   in the same way
 * - call ActionManager::setShortcuts() to change the shortcut for all actions
 *   addressed by the same internal name in all existing widget instances
 *
 * There is one more thing to consider:
 * As long as addShortcut() is called and addAction() is not, actionText() will
 * return the internal name instead of the localized name. It might therefore
 * be a good idea to create an instance of the corresponding widget at application
 * startup, create all actions for it, and immediately delete it again.
