//! Interface for import operations.
/**
 * The least common denominator of all import operations is that they read data from a device
 * (typically, but not necessarily, a file), interpret it in a filter-specific way (as project files
 * in SciDaVis/QtiPlot legacy format, Origin project, CSV table, image, ...) and convert it to the
 * corresponding internal representation (Project, Table, Graph, ...). The application kernel takes
 * care of all the pesky details, such as letting the user choose one or more files to import or
 * adding the resulting Aspect either to the current project or a newly created one.
 *
 * The main design goal was to make implementing import filters as easy as possible. Therefore,
 * filter options are simply declared as Qt properties; the implementation does not have to bother
 * with providing a GUI for its options (this task is taken over by ImportDialog). This approach
 * allows fast prototyping of import filters, but leaves some things to be desired usability-wise
 * (localized option labels, tool tips, intelligent layout, etc.). Some of these deficiencies could
 * be overcome by adding extra methods to filters
 * (e.g. Qstring labelText(const char * property_name)), but presumably one will want to replace the
 * auto-generated GUI with a custom one once the filter is completely implemented and tested. This
 * is done by providing a method "QWidget * makeOptionsGui();". The result of calling
 * this method is then used by ImportDialog instead of the auto-generated GUI. The filter still has
 * to inherit from QObject and use the Q_OBJECT macro, since otherwise there's no way of testing for
 * the presence of this method.
